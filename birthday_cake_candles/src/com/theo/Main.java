/**
 * You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year
 * of her total age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones. Your task is to
 * find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
 *
 * For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4,4,1,3 she will be
 * able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4 and there are 2 such candles.
 *
 * Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number
 * of candles she can blow out.

    * The thought behind this algorithm is, we sort a list px array(3): 4, 14 , 14
    * Then we set the result to 1, because even with 1 candle, it is the tallest, so we have a result
    * Then we check if there are 2 candles in our array (left side of the while statement) 2 <= array.length,
    * if it is 1 returns immediately 1.
    * Then we first check the 2 last elements of the array -> ar[2] == ar[1], if they are returns is been
    * incremented by one and then we check again withe the other elements one by one.
    * with decrement = 3 -> ar[2] == ar[3-3=0] -> 14 ! 4 -> exit loop and take the result!
